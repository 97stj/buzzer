# Buzzer

A little buzzer app for running your own quizzes or game shows! Uses websockets to sent messages.

The players goto the homepage, example: buzzer.buffer.com and they can enter their name and team
number. Joining will give them a giant buzzer button!

The host heads over to `/host` and will be able to see everyone that buzzes in and clear the list
in between questions:
